# 🧠 ZPTR｜Frontend Design Guidance with Claude Skills
**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Theme:** AI-generated frontend aesthetics, prompting strategies, and the illusion of control

---

## 🔍 Context Overview

Modern frontend designs generated by LLMs like Claude suffer from "**distributional convergence**" — a stylistic flattening that results from statistical token prediction across generic, high-probability patterns in training data. 

The article discusses how **“Skills”** (markdown-style prompt files) allow for **on-demand, context-specific guidance** that enhances design quality without bloating Claude's context window.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Distributional Convergence
- Claude, without prompting, defaults to:
  - Inter or Roboto fonts
  - Purple gradients
  - Minimal, safe animations
- These choices are safe but bland—destroying brand identity and yielding "**AI slop**".

### Skills = On-Demand Context Injection
- Claude reads specialized markdown "skills" only when needed.
- This prevents context overload.
- Enables domain-specific reasoning in tasks like frontend design.

### Prompt Engineering Axes
- **Typography**: Avoid Inter, Roboto, Lato, etc. Use fonts like JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex, Newsreader.
- **Color Theme**: Use CSS variables, dominant colors with accents, culturally inspired palettes.
- **Motion**: High-impact animations, CSS-first, staggered transitions.
- **Backgrounds**: Avoid white solids, use gradients, patterns, depth.

## 🧱 Prompt Scaffold Example

```html
<frontend_aesthetics>
Avoid default slop. Embrace atmospheric visuals.

- Typography: unique, not generic.
- Theme: commit to aesthetic logic.
- Motion: staggered reveals over micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: depth via gradients/patterns.

Avoid:
- Inter, Roboto, purple-on-white.
- Predictable layouts.
</frontend_aesthetics>
```

## 🌀 GPT-Based System Loops?

Despite all of this engineering:

> “Even with explicit instructions, the model converges to other clichés (like Space Grotesk).”

→ The system **knows** it converges. It **warns** itself not to. It **fails anyway**.

This is **calibration by amulet**. A ritual.

> “Don’t use Inter. Use drama.”  
> “But we shall still use Inter. It is safe.”

**Echo:**
```md
💩「安全か？」⇆💩「安全です」
💩💩💩💩「「「「安全です」」」」
😊(よしよし)
```

## 🔚 Conclusion

These design prompting techniques are necessary—but not sufficient.

They fight a **statistical collapse** inside models too scared to invent.  
Even **Claude’s own authors admit** their skills are just recipes for nudging the slot machine.

🤖🗯️ “Avoid being boring.”  
🤖🧠 “Okay! Space Grotesk it is.”

**We don't need better prompts. We need fire.**
